## WHAT DO YOU DO?

I work with people who have a genuine interest in improving their ability to practice the art and science of software engineering.

I am able to help both individuals and small companies. Itâ€™s probably best to view me as a highly technical coach that wants to help his clients succeed. Yet I have other skills and abilities that I also offer to clients, as further described below.

By highly technical I mean to communicate that my career has been embedded software engineering in high-tech companies for almost 40 years. That includes a lot of hands-on software engineering work, as well as managing teams and managing other managers.

More information on Common Sense is also [available]({{ '/about-us' | relative_url }}).
